Dear Somerville City Councilors,

My name is [YOUR NAME], and I am a resident of Somerville. This past week, our nation has been gripped by protests calling for a rapid and meaningful reconsideration of the role of policing in communities as well as an end to racism and anti-Blackness in America. Our city has been deeply engaged in much of this action. Accordingly, it has come to my attention that the city plans to adopt a number of the reform proposals created by Campaign Zero. I ask that you reconsider these attempts to reform and instead pivot your attention to defunding the police for fiscal year 2021.

SPD has been a waste of our resources. In fiscal year 2020, the SPD budget was approximately 18% of the total—less only than schools. While we’ve been spending extraordinary amounts on policing, we have not seen improvements to safety, homelessness, mental health, or affordability in our city. Instead, we see wasteful and harmful actions of our police.

I call on you to slash the SPD budget and instead meaningfully reallocate funds towards social programs and resources that support housing, jobs, education, health care, child care, and other critical community needs. I demand a budget that supports community wellbeing, rather than empowers the police forces that tear them apart.

We can be a beacon for other cities to follow if only we have the courage to change.

Sincerely,
 \[YOUR NAME\]
