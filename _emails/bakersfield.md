  Dear Mayor and City Council,

  My name is [YOUR NAME], I am a resident of [YOUR WARD/NEIGHBORHOOD]. We demand reallocation of funding from BPD to social and public programming that takes place in our communities. It is an outrage that nearly a quarter of the city funding for 2021 is planned towards the Police Department and that Chief Terryâ€™s salary is nearly $300,000.

  We demand that the City Council defund the BPD. We join the calls of those across the country to \#DefundThePolice. We demand a budget that adequately and effectively meets the needs of at-risk Bakersfield residents during this trying and uncertain time, when livelihoods are on the line. We demand a budget that supports community wellbeing, rather than empowers the police forces that tear them apart.

  It is your duty to represent your constituents. I am urging you to completely revise the Bakersfield city budget for 2020-2021 fiscal year, and to fund \#CareNotCops. Public opinion is with me.

  Thank you for your time,

  [YOUR NAME]
