subject: Defund the Abbotsford Police
body: |
  Dear Mayor Henry Braun and Council,

  My name is [BLANK] and I live in Abbotsford, BC. I am emailing you today to express my outrage about how much of our tax dollars are going towards the Abbotsford Police Department. According to the 2020-2024 Draft Financial Plan Powerpoint presentation by staff, 21% of the overall budget is being allocated to the police. This is just as much money as Culture (2%), Recreation (8%), Parks (5%) and Transit (6%) combined. This is unacceptable. The city of Abbotsford needs to work towards complete abolition of the police and that starts with defunding them.

  I am asking that you, as my elected officials, pledge to do the following: 

  1. To never again vote to increase the Abbotsford Police budget.

  2. Prioritize the expansion of community-led health and safety initiatives over future financial investment into the Abbotsford Police Department.

  3. Scrap the proposed $60 million renovation and expansion of Abbotsford Police Headquarters. 

  Time and time again, communities made vulnerable (Black, Indigenous, people of colour, the LGBTQQ2S+ community, unhoused people, street-based sex workers, people with disabilities, people experiencing poverty) have all expressed concern of being over policed and underserved by the police. We have seen the deaths of Regis Korchinski-Paquet in Toronto and D’Andre Campbell in Brampton. Both Regis and D’Andre were Black and both of them were suffering from a mental health crisis, yet armed officers were the people who responded and both ended up dead at the hands of police. Black lives matter.

  In Winnipeg, three Indigenous people were murdered by Winnipeg police in a span of 10 days. The victims were Eishia Hudson (16 years old), Jason Collins (36 years old) and Stewart Kevin Andrews (22 years old). Indigenous lives matter.

  Instead of investing in the police, our city must prioritize alternatives like education, increased mental health services, housing initiatives, income security, harm reduction services, accessible rehabilitation, arts and cultural programs, social workers, conflict resolution services, transformative justice, and other vital community-based support systems. These initiatives must support our most vulnerable communities and centre the experiences of Black and Indigenous peoples in Abbotsford. 

  Here are a few examples oh how diverting money for police could directly benefit communities in Abbotsford instead:

  Money from the police budget can be used to bolster transit. As a result, we could make transit free for everybody in this city and even invest in fully electric buses. Not only would this benefit everybody in this city, particular low income communities and people of colour, but it would encourage more people to use transit instead of their vehicles and make our city greener, cleaner and healthier for everyone by taking single occupancy vehicles off the street. 

  Money from the policing budget can be used to create a new division of trained medical professionals, social workers and mental health experts that could be called with a number other than 911. They would know how to help, de-escalate and support people who are suffering from a mental health crisis. The person asking for assistance would be provided with the support and help that they need and would be safe.

  Money from the policing budget can be used to fund more harm reduction services which would help the people who are suffering from opioid addiction and prevent them from being criminalized on the streets by police. If we also decriminalized activities such as drug use, sex work and other currently illegal activities, we would eliminate the need for more police to even be on the street.

  Money from the policing budget can be used to fund more affordable housing here in Abbotsford instead of being used to hire police officers that often criminalize low income and unhoused communities. 

  Money from the policing budget can be used to fund more after school programs and extra-curricular activities in schools. Abbotsford has a gang violence problem and bolstering the police force has not stopped this violence from occurring.

  These are just a few examples of how we can defund the police and use our tax dollars in a more just and productive way. The city of Abbotsford needs to reject the notion that more police makes for a safer community when the communities who interact with the police the most often are telling you that they don’t feel safe or secure.

  No amount of training, restructuring, or diversifying of the police force will ever change the fact that the police is an inherently racially violent institution and upholds white supremacy in Canada. The police started out as a means to protect wealthy white people and to retrieve slaves that had liberated themselves from their slave owners. The RCMP started out as the North West Mounted Police and was founded to commit genocide against Indigenous peoples and to remove them off their own unceded lands to make way for white settlers. The BC RCMP, at this very moment, are invading unceded Indigenous lands to help private corporations build pipelines that will enrich private, foreign owned stakeholders. This is happening right now in the unceded Wet’suwet’en Nation in BC. The police have never been the arbiters of public safety and it is time for Abbotsford, the Mayor and the entire council to realize this, much like how communities made vulnerable have.

  Thank you.
