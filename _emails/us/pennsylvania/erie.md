subject: Reallocate Funding From the Erie Police Department
body: |-
  Dear Erie Mayor's Office, City Council Members and other City Officials,

  My name is [YOUR NAME] from [YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD]. Nearly a quarter of Erie's overall budget goes into funding for the Erie Bureau of Police. This is unacceptable. I urge you towards a reallocation of the Erie expense budget, away from Erie PD and towards social services and educational services.

  Sincerely,
  [YOUR NAME]
  [YOUR ADDRESS]
